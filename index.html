        <div id="About_Me">About Me</div>
            <p> I am currently in the process of learning how to be a full stack developer.
                I have a daughter that is 9 years old right now, and I definitely don't want her
                to continue getting older, not looking forward to the teen years in the slighest.
                When I have the time I really enjoy traveling, as you might be able to tell from my banner.  
                It has been tough the last couple years because I haven't been able to do as much as I did before.
                Another favorite past time is to go out for hikes and exploring places I haven't been before with the family.
                I also have a flare for mechanics, currently working (slowly) on fixing a 1978
                Chevy C10 Stepside the was the very first vehicle I ever worked on with my dad
                some 20 plus years ago.  It left the family for a few years but I was able to track it down
                to a farm in New Mexico after it had changed hands a few times.  It has been a large project 
                but when I do get to drive it there is always someone I run into that wants to buy it which is a great
                feeling to know that my hard work is paying off
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>       
            <p>In regards to my career experience, I have just as much variety as the rest of my life.
                I started out as a mechanic for Jiffy Lube while I was in highschool, even went and
                got a degree in Auto Collision Repair.  After 5 years there I had made it to being the store manager and 
                had taken the store to be the leading store out of 14 in Colorado Springs at the time.
                After that I had some time at Home Depot working in the lumber department, which was nice but didn't show
                much room for development.  After there I did a staffing agency where I had multiple random jobs until I was assigned
                Aeroflex.  It was contracted for a 6 month term to track inventory and supplies needed to manufactuer
                a wide variety of computer chips and components.  Within 2 months they offered me a full time position and hired me outright.
                I designed and implimented a system to track and monitor millions of dollars worth of material, learned how to work in the clean room
                and perform the opperation of attaching the chipset inside the processors as well as cutting of the die.  After close to 3 years
                I decided I was going to join the U.S. Air Force.  After I joined I was trained to be Aircraft Armarment Technician.  I was entrusted to 
                maintain and load the weapon system of the F-16 aircraft at Luke AFB, AZ.  I did deploy as well to Iraq during my time on active duty for 6 months.
                After just under 6 years I decided to transition to the Air Force Reserves and became an Aeromedical Evacuation Technician.  I received training 
                on how to transport and treat injured personel on fixed wing aircraft.  I obtained my Emergency Medical Technician certification 
                as well as additional abilites that are more outside the scope of an EMT.  During my time in the Air Force Reserves I worked to become a nurse, as well as worked at 
                the local hospital as an EMT for the Critical Care Transport team and as a Trauma bay EMT when not doing any transports. Lastly, I was 
                also in charge of designing and implimenting a testing procedure of COVID-19 for the United States Air Force Academy Athletic Department.  The testing was of
                all the cadets that were on collegiate teams. During peak season we were able to collect and test samples of 100 cadets an hour, giving results within 15 minutes of collection 
                with only a staff of 3 people. The hurdles faced with scheduling those tests to work around the cadets busy schedule of school and practice was challenging
                and would not have been achievable without the rest of the process that I created for them. Overall, the military provided me with 13 years of invaluable experience 
                and opportunities but it was time for me to do something that better utilized my ablities on a regular basis.
